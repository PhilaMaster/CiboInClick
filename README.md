# CiboInClick - Android App

## Overview

**CiboInClick** is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of ordering food from local restaurants. Users can explore a variety of culinary options, view menus, and place orders directly through the app. With location-based suggestions, restaurant recommendations based on user habits, and a review system, CiboInClick offers a personalized, intuitive food ordering experience.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: The app supports both Italian and English. Users can switch between languages using the flag icons in the main interface.
- **User Registration and Login**: The app allows users to register with basic information (name, username, password, etc.) or log in using their credentials. The app also saves the username for a smoother login experience.
- **Location-based Services**: The app uses the user's GPS location to automatically detect nearby restaurants, eliminating the need to manually enter the city or location.
- **Smart Recommendations**: The app suggests restaurants based on:
  - **Previous Reservations**: The app recommends restaurants that the user has ordered from in the past or made reservations for.
  - **Day of the Week**: The app remembers the user's weekly dining habits and offers recommendations based on the day of the week.
- **Interactive Restaurant Map**: Users can view nearby restaurants on an interactive map. The map shows markers for restaurants such as pizza places, sushi bars, and burger joints.
- **Real-Time Ordering**: Users can browse restaurant menus, see prices, and place orders directly from the app.
- **Restaurant Reviews**: The app includes a review system where users can rate restaurants based on food quality and price. Users can also view previous reviews and ratings.
- **Order Details**: Each restaurant page provides options to call the restaurant directly or access its reviews and ratings.

## How It Works

1. **Opening the App**:
   - The app automatically detects the user's location via GPS.
   - The home screen shows up to 2 restaurant recommendations based on previous reservations or dining habits.

2. **Exploring Menus**:
   - The app provides buttons for categories like **Pizza**, **Sushi**, and **Hamburgers**.
   - Clicking on a category will display a map with markers showing nearby restaurants.
   - Users can select a restaurant to view the menu, prices, and place an order.

3. **Making a Reservation**:
   - Users can make a reservation based on previous bookings or by day-of-week preferences. For example, if a user regularly orders pizza on Tuesdays, the app will recommend the pizza place they usually visit.

4. **Reviewing Restaurants**:
   - Users can rate a restaurant based on food quality and price using a star-based rating system.
   - The app shows all reviews for a restaurant and allows users to submit new ones with comments.

## Related Work

**CiboInClick** has several features that differentiate it from other food ordering apps like **JustEat**:

- **Automatic Location Detection**: Unlike JustEat, which may require users to manually enter their location, CiboInClick automatically detects the user's location through GPS.
- **Smart Recommendations**: CiboInClick offers personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences (e.g., past reservations and daily habits), while JustEat may focus more on general popularity or reviews.
- **Review System**: Both apps feature review systems, but CiboInClick separates ratings for food and price, allowing users to provide more specific feedback.
